Rules of play
	Arbitrary Grid Size (rows/columns => 2 x 3)
	Winning Condition = 4 consecutive for any grid size

Rules of code
	No pre-programmed strategies
	No AI libraries first pass
	AI libraries second pass

Interfaces

	IPlayer{
		IBoard PlayMove(IBoard, Square.SquareValue);
		//	Second pass includes time constraints
	}

	IBoard{
		Width
		Height

		Dictionary<ICell, Square.SquareValue>

		//	Proposing this instead of the Dictionary
		ICell[,] State
	}

	ICell{
		int x
		int y
	}

	Host/Mediator verifies state of the board
	Second pass Mediator enforces time constraints
